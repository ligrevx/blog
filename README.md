- "Imagine someone stole something from you.  You can’t get it back, but if you could, if it had a kill switch that could be remote triggered, would you do it?  Would it be a good thing for thieves to know that everything you own has a kill switch and if they steal it, it’ll be useless to them, although you still lose it too?  If they give it back, you can re-activate it." - Satoshi Nakamoto
