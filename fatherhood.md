- don't feed your children with devices. 
- don't let your children live with the devices, let them live with you. 
- don't let them feel they can't live w/o the devices, let them feel they can't live w/o you.
- support your children whatever they want as long as they are using their skills and talents.
- don't force your children to your own desire if they don't, instead support their own good desire.
- as a parent listen to your children
